# Colour-Mapping-in-Python
Using plotly library of python to plot a colour mapping of temperature using choropleth maps and data from a csv file(opened using pandas)

This repo is for people to get their hands on choropleth mapping of data graphically.
I used a .csv file for data of the temperature of various places and the same is represented visually using plotly library of python.
